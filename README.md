# 🧠 Personality Traits Analysis using RoBERTa

This repository contains a Python-based application that analyzes personality traits using the RoBERTa language model. The model is fine-tuned to predict the Big Five personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) from textual data.
